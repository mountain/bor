# bor
bor is a set of dongba characters in metafont; 'bor' itself is 'write' in dongba.
bor is an amateur project when I want to relax myself during the busy days.

## roadmap and progress

* ✅ kickoff: when we only finish several characters, but we setup a working framework
* 🚧 cultivating: when we finish dozens of characters, we gain monument
* 🚧 experimental: when we only finish several hundred characters, people can reference them by include a tex file
* 🚧 mature: when we finish about two thousand characters, we may release a ctan package
